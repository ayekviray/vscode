How to completely remove Visual Studio Code in Ubuntu 16.04 LTS (installed using apt)

To uninstall vscode program via terminal just type:
	sudo apt purge code

To remove vscode icons and other realated items:
	sudo apt autoremove

	Here the problem exist. When you try re-installing vscode, settings from your previous vscode 
	installation resurfaces such as but not limited to plugins, themes, keybinds, etc. Even your 
	previously opened project, which should not be the case as it is a brand new intallation.

In this case, you should remove the following folders:
	a. specific user settings located in $HOME/.config/Code

		xxx-xxxx:~$ cd .config
		xxx-xxxx:~/.config$ rm -R Code

	and

	b. extensions found in $HOME/.vscode

		xxx-xxxx:~$ rm -R .vscode

Or search them and manually remove said folders.


Hope this helps.

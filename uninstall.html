      How to completely remove Visual Studio Code in Ubuntu 16.04 LTS (installed
      using apt)
    </h1>

    <div>
      <p>To uninstall vscode program via terminal just type:</p>
      <b>sudo apt purge code</b>

      <p>To remove vscode icons and other realated items:</p>
      <b>sudo apt autoremove</b>
    </div>

    <div>
      <p>
        Here the problem exist. When you try re-installing vscode, settings from
        your previous vscode installation resurfaces such as but not limited to
        plugins, themes, keybinds, etc. Even your previously opened project,
        which should not be the case as it is a brand new intallation.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div>
      <p>In this case, you should remove the following folders:</p>
      <p>a. specific user settings located in $HOME/.config/Code</p>

      <b><i>xxx-xxxx:~$</i> cd .config</b>
      <b> <i>xxx-xxxx:~/.config$</i> rm -R Code</b>

      <p>and</p>

      <p>b. extensions found in $HOME/.vscode</p>

      <b><i>xxx-xxxx:~$</i> rm -R .vscode</b>

      <p>Or search them and manually remove said folders.</p>

      <p>Hope this helps.</p>
